# Vector search online
Vector search online ([vector-s](https://vector-search-online.com/) is a simple web app that allows the user to easily experiment with using embeddings to search for strings. Useful for applications that want to leverage LLM capabilities to match content to a users query. 

For example the user can search for "Yellow fruit", and then provide 3 possible search results "Banana", "Apple", "Orange".

The program then makes a match score for the different string.

The purpose is to test out different combinations of inputs and outputs before you make the embedding in your own application.
